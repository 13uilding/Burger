# Burger

++++ABOUT++++

This application allows the user to add burgers to an uneaten list. The user can then eat whatever burger they want. Then they can choose to regurgitate the burger or digest it. Regurgitating puts the burger back into the to be eaten list, while the delete button removes the burger from the database. The application was designed to get me familiar with working with a deployed website and remote database.

++++TECHNOLOGIES USED++++

I used MySQL workbench for my local host database, and used JAWSDB_URL as my remote database. I used heroku to host the app, and I used handlebars to template the app. I used the following node packages express, express-handlebars, handlebars, mysql, and mysql2.

++++TAKE AWAY++++

I spent many hours trying to get my external database to work. I think I should try to get better at reading heroku's logs if I plan on using them in the future. At the end of the day, I had a bad line of code in my connection file.
